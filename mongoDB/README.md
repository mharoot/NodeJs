# Using MongoDB with Node.js



MongoDB General Information:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MongoDb is an increasingly popular document-based, high performance NoSQL database.  In MongoDB, data is stored as a document as a set of key-value pairs.  You can define multiple databases in MongoDB where each database can have many collections, and those collections are simply a set of documents that consist of data stored as a key-value pair.



Connection:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1. On the command line type: npm install mongodb.
	2. Copy and paste connection.js provided for you in the connect folder.
	3. connection.js is broken down into logical steps for you to follow the rest of the steps in making a connection to a mongodb server.



Inserting data:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1. Copy and paste insert.js provided for you in the insert folder.
	2. insert.js uses connection.js as a skeleton.
	3. insert.js is broken down into logical steps inside the function createSomeUsers(db){ // code here }



Command Line Definitions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
