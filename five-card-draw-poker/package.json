  "description": "Each player gets a set of five cards.  They only ever have five cards throughout the game.  There is a set of draws; each player can choose to throw away between one and all of their cards and then draw that same number of cards from the deck to replace them.  A player can also choose not to discard any of their cards during each draw.  Typically there are two draws per player so there are technicall three rounds; the final round is the reveal.  On the third round all players now have their hands comapred against each other.  The player with the best hand then wins.",
